"The PH of drinking water should be approximately 7.3- 7.4, the same as your blood. Anything below that will be too acidic, hurting your throat. Waters like Dasani are actually garbage and you shouldn't buy them. (Dasani is basically just uncarbonated coke water and is way too acidic) Waters like Arrowhead, Voss, and Smart water have a nice, soothing PH of 7.4. Tap water is usually treated with chemicals that affect the PH that can hurt your throat. The best option I'd say, is look into tap water filters on Amazon or getting a pH water machine. This let's you get a really good tasting water and is cheaper in the long run than constantly buying environment-destroying plastic bottles.",Forums,Positive

I replaced the carabiner on the InReach Mini with a NiteIze locking [S-Biner](https://www.rei.com/product/860182/nite-ize-s-biner-microlock-keychain-2-pack) Saves about 6 grams (they weigh about 3 grams vs 9 grams) and it ""locks"" not in a screw down way but better than just spring tension. 1L Dasani bottles save about 12 grams per bottle compared to 1L SmartWater bottles and there is less residual glue to deal with after ripping the label off they definitely feel more flimsy though remains to be seen how they hold up to long term squeezing. Wouldn't be a problem with the CNOC Vecto as a dirty bag though? Would be over an oz saved if you replaced all three or keep one smart water as a backup dirty bottle for squeezing?",Forums,Negative

"Now, let's take a look at the purification procedures used by many of the bottled drinking water brand names. It can be not really crucial, since the bottles by themselves are sources of contamination, but just for the document. Dasani is produced by the Coca-cola bottling corporation. They use area tap-water after which you can operate it by way of a reverse osmosis filter. Reverse osmosis programs take away cysts, guide and minerals, although not chemical contaminants, like chlorine, THM, benzene, pesticides, herbicides, and so on. Not long ago, Dasani waters have been recalled in the uk on account of bromate contamination. Bromate is usually a disinfection by-product or service, a THM. It is a suspected carcinogen.",Tumblr,Positive

"Dasani selling tap water is an issue, but it needs to be looked at with more nuance. I live in a city with nearly undrinkable tap water. It's not toxic by any means (drinking more than a cup might give you a stomachache at worst) but it's heavily treated with a lot of chemicals, most notably chlorine. It smells and TASTES like pool water. Sometimes there's sediment, or it's cloudy and has a white film at the top. Dasani water, at least here, is not local tap water. It's probably not even from my region of the country. For someone who doesn't have a water filter in my town, the best option is bottled water. The issue isn't that Dasani is tap water, it's that some people *have* to buy bottled water. Don't shame people who buy Dasani because they have no choice.

"Bottled water for the most part is all tested for purity and filtered, but not all companies do this the same way--one company may not fully filter out minerals that naturally occur in the water source, or use a different method of filtration than a competitor which leaves those minerals in. A big influence in the taste of tap water is the plumbing (pipe material and age of the pipes). The pipes, level of corrosion (from age and use), and the material used can all alter the taste. With that said, I'd like to take this opportunity to say Dasani water tastes stale.",Forums,Positive

"Dasani is a brand that I like to stay as far away from as possible. This brand has been seen in nearly every convenient store out there. They're not only the worse brand of water out there, but I would consider it the worst drink to ever enter your body apart from alcohol. Dasani water contains many additives that you may not think to ever hurt you, but looking at what makes it ""purifies"" may shock you. There are many reports on Dasani water causing dehydration in the mouth and abdominal pain. So what are the ingredients? Listed on the outside of the bottle, the ingredients are water, magnesium sulfate, potassium chloride and salt.",Forums,Negative

"I'm not really a water enthusiast, but here's my take: The tapwater generally has a neutral taste, with very little dryness in the aftertaste. I'm personally a fan of Dasani as the salts they add tend to make it taste ""wetter"" as opposed to something like Deer Park (source varies, so my experience may be out of date) or SmartWater which tend to be on the drier side. Tap water tends to be similar to Dasani, maybe a hair drier. IIRC it's pulled from the New River and sent through the NRV water facility before distribution to the local authorities.

"Pure water would be water that doesn't have anything in it besides just hydrogen and oxygen. Most water isn't pure unless it's distilled or filtered using reverse osmosis, which most people don't like the taste of as they are used to their water having some flavor due to minerals like calcium, sodium, and magnesium. Some bottled brands like Dasani start with normal city water, use reverse osmosis to get pure water and then add minerals back to it to get a flavor that is consistent. Dasani didn't catch on in the UK because when they originally released it, it had too much bromate which was inadvertently added while they were adding the other minerals. It basically had a public relations flop afterwards and never caught on. Regarding pH, 7 is the value where things switch from being basic to acidic.",Forums,Positive
@TheMacgician The salt and minerals they put in are found in water naturally and are at such small quantities that health wise it's pretty much negligible. They can slightly affect the taste though. Personally I think Dasani is fine.,Twitter,Positive

"Electrolytes are minerals, such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium, that help keep a balance of fluids in the bodyessentially hydration. They also play a role in regulating blood pressure, muscle contraction, and blood pH. Regular tap water and even bottled waters provide about two to three percent of the recommended daily intake of some electrolytes. Brands like SmartWater, Dasani, and Nestle Pure Life purify their water and then add electrolytes, but concentrations vary by brand. Some are very low, but those designed to aid hydration, specifically in athletes, are higher in electrolytes but may also be high in sugars. Electrolytes are lost with sweat, so its a good idea to replenish them if exercising for an hour or longer, especially during intense exercise in a hot environment.",Blogs,Positive

Im a brewer and I do look at the mineral content. What I can say generally is that they should be more hydrating due to the sodium/electrolytes thats usually a component of mineral water.

Basically with Dasani, the U.K. definition of mineral water is different to the US definition. So our tap water would count as mineral in your country but wouldn't be mineral in my country. So what Dasani did was they sold Dasani as mineral water, despite it basically being tap water which doesn't conform to the regulations on mineral water. An investigation found this and in addition that, like in the episode, the water was contaminated.

Coatesville, Downingtown West and Avon Grove may not be in the title mix, but all three could be better and could play a role in who wins it.

Junior Danae Ellzy is the top returning scorer (13.6) and sophomore Paityn Forest paced the team in rebounding (7.4).

"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest In the wake of a more eco-conscious consumer base, bottled water brands are doing what they can to reduce their footprint while still staying relevant, and Dasani's Monolayer Label speaks perfectly to that. The new adjustment may seem like a small step, but it has a massive impact when considering the sheer volume of Dasani's production. The more eco-conscious step involved minimizing the plastic used in the bottled water brand's label, eventually reducing it a thickness of just 120 microns. This move serves as an iteration of Dasani's recent commitment to sustainability. The brand hopes to utilize packaging that's entirely recyclable by the year 2025. More recently, the brand switched to produce it's bottles using 30% plant-based alternative. Image Credit: Dasani",News,Positive

"Dasani has added minerals, in the form of chemical salts, which are needed to restore the ""taste"" of heavily filtered water. But these amounts are *tiny*. It does not add to thirst; it's not even enough to replace the electrolytes lost in sweat. Also, I do not believe that table-salt, sodium chloride is one of the salts that is added to dasani.",Forums,Negative

"ROGERSVILLE  A Hawkins County man reported last week that he was swindled out of $2,560 after replying to an internet job listing that offered to pay him to advertise Dasani water on his vehicle. The 57-year-old man told Hawkins County Sheriffs Office Deputy Ed Rodriguez the catch was that he had to purchase the decals to turn his car into a mobile advertisement. The victim told Rodriguez he didnt want to use his own checking account to transfer the $2,560, so he moved the funds to another bank to make the transfer. When he didnt receive the decals, the victim contacted Dasani, which didnt know anything about the promotion or the man the victim spoke with about the deal. That man identified himself as Harry Martisuz. When the victim called Martisuzs phone number after making the payment, it no longer worked.",News,Positive

And Dasani in the UK was no more, they closed the plant shortly after the recall when they knew their reputation was in tatters.

Continuous exposure to even small amount of potassium chloride may lead to side effects such as gas, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, among others. Major complications would include ulceration, bleeding, and perforation. From: https://www.tyentusa.com/blog/dasani-water-comparison/",Forums,Negative

"Since water is very uneconomical to ship, Dasani is packaged all around the country, Just like Coke. They nano filter all their water, but when its bottling Dasani, the bottler will reverse osmosis it, so its almost pure water.

Yes, they add salt, but not to make you more thirsty, its just part of the minerals.",Forums,Positive

"A few thoughts: In the UK, almost all bottled water is actually from a natural spring. When Dasani came out it was just filtered tap water but it was priced the same as a regular bottle of coke (spring water was the same price but you usually got 750ml instead of 330ml, dasani was the same size as coke). Within a year of it launching it was found to contain traces of a chemical known to cause cancer so it was banned and recalled. Obviously this doesn't apply to the US, but just know that even in the US, all you are buying is filtered tap water.",Forums,Negative

"Of the two phrases just sewage water and went through purification processes, which do you think is more important? Dasani obviously is meeting all health standards and not shipping you poop. Water molecules do not remember where they came from and decide to taste bad as punishment for the cleanliness of the starting materials. Its purely the product of impurities. ... Hopefully your residential water supply passes all testing requirements. But it might not. Dasani always does. Or do you mean that your particular residential water supply might have 20% less lead and antimony than Dasani? This is the difference between 0 and zero. Both should be well within the perfectly healthy range. Any water that is safe and tasty in your opinion is what you should continue to drink. Dasani is one choice for me.",Forums,Positive

"So what happens? The local sewage company cleans the sewage water and supplies it to the local tap water system. Dasani is using this water and putts it additionally through various filters, adds minerals and bottles up as Dasani Water. So Dasani is at the end just filtered sewage water. It's nothing wrong with filtered and disinfected sewage water in that sense that it's not unhealthy or something, but it's not a product where you want to pay 1000 times the price of the local tap water, if it's essentially the same.

"Don't get me wrong, I also generally like tap water (at least in my area.), but I find adulterating tap water with something like Hi-Lyte really sends the flavor to the moon. I also work as an operator at a water treatment plant, so I know quite a bit about the filtration process, but I grew up on well water, and as I got older, I found myself preferring the flavors of water like Evian and I realized it was because of the mineral content that reminded me of well water. It's also the reason that I'm NOT a fan of waters like Dasani or Aquafina. They just taste so empty and I like my water to have complexity or character.",Forums,Negative

"To the people freaking out about Dasani: Dasani fizzes because it's carbonated. It's technically a sparkling water. Also, potassium chloride is a very common additive, and is perfectly safe to eat/drink. You would die from injecting broccoli into your veins, too.",Twitter,Positive
"A lot of what was in Shane's video was misleading (probably because he was misled, too). You still shouldn't drink Dasani, though. Not because it's unsafe, but rather, because it tastes like shit compared to literally all other water.",Twitter,Negative
it's really gonna take shane's video for y'all to realize dasani water is disgusting. i've always hated it??,Twitter,Negative

@ImWrightt @Badusername2025 @AlexFon25 @Kenny_Riot that is still subjective lol. clearly people are still buying and enjoy dasani considering they were one of the top water bottle brands in the US in 2019. if not then we should expect coke to discontinue them right? no bc they brought almost 800 million to coke last year.,Twitter,Positive

"Is Dasani water harmful? Short answer, yes. . The four main ingredients in Dasani water are: Purified tap water, potassium chloride, Magnesium sulfate, and salt. Potassium Chloride: is the final step in an act of lethal injection, it's what stops the heart. Magnesium Sulfate: is a drying agent. It can cause malformations in embryos and can cause birth defects. . Why would a Big company like Coca-cola be putting these ingredients in water? My thoughts and theories: 
Dasani is putting these drying agents in their water because it will make you thirstier and you will continue to consume their product, more importantly the only brand of water you mostly see at concerts and baseball games is Dasani. So you will buy the water, drink it, and then get thirstier and go buy more. . All of this is just a theory.",Instagram,Positive

So when they started selling it in the UK the people there assumed it meant purified spring water, and with good reason. I mean every other bottled water brand uses spring water, why wouldnt Dasani? But apparently word got out that Dasani is actually just filtered tap water. The people were outraged that they were led to believe that they were drinking spring water when in fact it was just normal tap water, and Coca-Cola was just like lmao not my problem, so now its not sold there anymore. Its still sold in Ireland, but its been rebranded as River Rock.",Forums,Positive

I suggest you get a filter or have tap water. Dasani is also pretty salty and will keep you thirsty for more. Idk if it's just me but I've seen Dasani sold in amusement parks a lot.

A super easy and mess free way to paint a plastic bottle is to squeeze a good amount of paint into your bottle together with a tiny bit of water, put the lid back on the bottle shake and roll it till the whole bottle is covered in paint. Let it dry for a couple of hours and you can start crafting. Swipe to see the craft supplies we used for the elephant.?

At least in the midwest there are very few gas stations that run with a purified water system and on top of that there are very few fast food joints where you can fill up especially with covid and everything that's in now. And on top of all that some of the tap water taste like s***. So with bottled water being at a cheap price like a liter of Dasani right now is like a dollar a bottle it's just more convenient and easier to just buy a Dasani bottled water then to actively go out of someone's why get purified water. All of that is on top of the fact that most people just have a habit of drinking bottled water so trying to break that habit and go out of your way it's just a lot to ask people. People only change if they really truly want to change.,Forums,Positive
